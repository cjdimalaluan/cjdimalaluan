			<p> <strong> Henlo ðŸ’• </strong> </p> 

			<p> It has been a while. <em> wazzup? </em> HAHAHAH  </p>

			<p> Okk corny nito <em>(I would like to call this modern love letter)</em> but I think I have to say this. </p>

			<p> Una, I'm sorry if I've given you the anxiety  that this whole thing will go to some ghosting. Pero lilinawin ko lang, I don't have plans to do that. </p> 


			<p> I am working on my blog so I have been studying how to code and build my own website from scratch these past days kasi ayaw ko sana gumastos para sa template subscription. Unfortunately, kailangan pa rin pala bumili ng sariling domain <em>smh</em>. So far ito palang kaya kong gawin <EM>hays</EM>  malinaw na talaga sa akin kung bakit ako umalis sa EEE. </p>

			<p> Anyway, I think we need to talk about us. I feel guilty kasi I have been cold lately. I like you a lot, Bianca. Keeping up with you for the past three months helped me survive the lockdown. I hope you feel the same, too. I really appreciate how you keep on initiating the conversations and sorry for always being the seener. But that is me. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in you, more than you may know. I just don't have the social skills to maintain a talk longer than usual, particularly when it comes to online chat. But in person, when time comes and things get back to normal, babawi ako, if you'll allow me.</p>

			<p>Also, I just want to say, I don't want you to feel obligated to talk to me if you don't want to, I don't want to add to your anxiety, although I like it when you do updates so randomly. I know we never bonded before and we got to know things about each other just online, but I think that doesn't mean we started it wrong. </p>

			<p> Everything around us paces relatively slow right now and there is nothing much happening about our lives, but I don't want to end things between us. I want to know you more and I want you to know me better, too. Sana matapos na itong pandemic. Gusto ko nang uminom and gumimik kasama ka. Right now, let's just focus on doing our own things, together.</p>
