			<p> <strong> Dear Bianca, </strong> </p> 	<br><br>

			<p> <em>Happy Valentine's Day!</em> ðŸ’•  </p>

			<p> May the gifts start your busy day with love and understanding. Now that you are starting a new chapter of your life as you are moving to your new home, I wish that you'll have a more comfortable journey in QC and become happier than you have ever been without the bad memories of your previous homes. </p>

			<p> I wish I can kiss you, hug you, and be with you today. I wish I can always be right by your side. But we are in a situation that neither of us can control, and there's only so much that I could do to let you know how sincere I have been about you. </p> 


			<p> Let this letter be also my goodbye, for now. What we had for the past year has already been a part of me and I will be ever grateful for that. Thank you for being you, that has moved me to pursue better things. But we are still in a situation where there is no chance to see the best of what we can have, and it ruins me. Talking with you, sharing my boring day and crazy thoughts, without being with you, ruins me. As much you make my heart flutter,  our situation also breaks it. I can't do it. It's not for me and you deserve to know. I want a pause.

 </p>

			<p> Please send my hugs to Toshi and Tasha, I can't wait to meet them. I hope they're enough to make you feel safe and loved for the time being. Until we meet again. </p>
